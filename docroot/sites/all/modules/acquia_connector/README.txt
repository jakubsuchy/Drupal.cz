Acquia Network Connector modules
================================================================================

The Acquia Network [1] enhances the Drupal experience by providing the support
and network services to operate a trouble-free Drupal website. Subscribers to
the Acquia Network gain access to remote network services, documentation and
the Acquia Network's subscriber forums. Premium subscriptions provide
web-based ticket management, as well as email and telephone support.

These modules allow you to connect any Drupal 6.x site to the Acquia Network.
Acquia also has a distribution of Drupal called Acquia Drupal which is
composed of purely open source GPL licensed components. If you are looking
for a quick start with Drupal, Acquia Drupal [2] might be of great use for you.
(Note that a few Acquia Network services, such as the update notification and
code modification detection services, currently only work with Acquia Drupal.)
