Preparation
===========

1. Go to 'administer -> settings' and configure the file system settings. Make
   sure that 'Download method' is set to 'Public'. (The module will work if
   you use the private download method, but you will have to grant anonymous
   users access to download files.)

2. Go to 'administer -> modules' and enable upload.module if you wish to use
   uploaded images or text files as banners.

3. Optional: Download and install scheduler.module if you wish to schedule
   publishing and unpublishing of your banners.


Installation and configuration
==============================

1. Copy the banner directory to your Drupal modules directory.

2. Copy the files 'banner_db.php' and 'banner_file.php' to your site root.

3. Go to 'administer -> modules' and enable the banner module. The module will
   automatically create the banner table in the database.

4. Go to 'administer -> settings -> banner' and configure the banner module.
   At a minimum, you will have to configure the cache settings.

   Cache settings: Choose the cache handler you wish to use. The database
   handler always works and has more advanced taxonomy filtering than the
   file handler. The file handler is much faster than the database handler.

   FIXME: Description of taxonomy filtering

5. If you don't want new banners to be displayed on the front page with your
   other nodes, go to 'administer -> settings -> content types -> banner' and
   uncheck the 'Promoted to front page' setting.

6. Go to 'administer -> access control' and configure the banner permissions.
   The following permissions are available:

      'administer banners' - users can add/edit/delete all banners on your site
      'create banners' - users can create and manage banners
      'view banners' - users can view banners


Create banners
==============

Banners are just another type of node. Go to 'create content -> banner' to
create a new banner.

The banner module supports four banner modes: Upload, text, JavaScript and
remote. The following fields are used by all the modes:

   Title: Shown in admin overviews and when viewing the banner as a node
   Description: Shown when viewing the banner as a node

   URL: The URL users are taken to when clicking the banner
   Target: The frame target for the banner URL
   Status: Set to 'enabled' to publish the banner immediately
   Group: The banner group the new banner belongs to

Modes
-----

Upload: Use the upload mode if you want to use an uploaded image or a text file
as a banner. Enter the basic banner information and click 'File attachments' on
the node edit form. You can add as many files as you wish to your banner, but
only the first file on the list will be used. If you are uploading a text file,
the text '%url' is replaced by the banner URL (e.g. banner/7) when the banner
is displayed.

Text: Use the text mode if you wish to enter the banner text directly on the
node edit form. Enter the banner text in the 'Content' field. The text '%url'
is replaced by the banner URL (e.g. banner/7) when the banner is displayed.

JavaScript: Use the JavaScript mode if you wish to use a piece of JavaScript to
display your banner. Enter the JavaScript in the 'Content' field. This won't
support Google ads without manual modification of your site template to include
Google's JavaScript.

Remote: Use the remote mode to use a remote image as a banner. Enter the URL of
the remote image in the 'Content' field.


Show banners
============

You can either use the banner blocks provided by the module or create your own.
If you need special banner placements, you can modify your theme to insert
banners anywhere you want.

Banner blocks
-------------

1. Go to 'administer -> blocks' and click the 'configure' link next to the
   'Banner group 1' block. The following setting is available:

      Banner count: Show this many different banners from the banner group

2. Select the placement of the block and enable it.

One block is created for each banner group on the site. You can add banner
groups by adding terms to the Banner groups vocabulary (go to 'administer ->
categories').

Theme
-----

Insert a the following PHP code in your template to display banners:

  <?php print banner_display(1, 3) ?>

The code above will try to display three different banners from banner group 1.
Each banner will only be shown once for each call to banner_display().

To show one banner from banner group 1 and one banner from banner group 4,
you can use the following PHP code:

  <?php print banner_display(1, 1); print banner_display(4, 1) ?>


Frequently asked questions
==========================

Q. I don't see any images. What's wrong?
A. Be sure you installed 'banner_db_php' and 'banner_file.php', and
   properly set the permissions on these files so they can be read
   by your webserver. (See step 2 of "Installation and configuration"
   in INSTALL.txt.)

   Alternatively, you may have to add the correct path to magic.mime to your
   php.ini file, e.g.:

   mime_magic.magicfile = "/usr/share/misc/file/magic.mime"

Q. I did install the files correctly, but I still don't see any images.
   What's wrong?
A. Try refreshing the banner cache.
   Go to: 'administer -> banner -> refresh cache'

Q. I've refreshed my cache, but I'm still not seeing images. What's wrong?
A. Edit the banner and be sure that the MIME type was properly detected. Go
   to:
      administer -> banner -> list
   then click 'edit' next to problematic banner. At the bottom of the page
   you can update the MIME type.
