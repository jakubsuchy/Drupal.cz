msgid "Static page caching is a mechanism which stores dynamically generated web pages as HTML files in a special cache directory located under the Drupal installation directory. By caching a web page in this manner, the web server can serve it out in the fastest possible manner, without invoking PHP or Drupal at all. While this does provide a significant performance and scalability boost, you should note that it could have negative usability side-effects unless your site is targeted at an audience consisting mostly of \"anonymous\" visitors."

The minimum cache lifetime is the minimum amount of time that will go by before the cache is emptied and recreated. A larger minimum cache lifetime offers better performance, but users will not see new content for a longer period of time."
