This lists some of the users of Boost, describing the setup of the website
in question as well as providing rationale on how Boost benefits the site.
It is hoped that the cases described here may serve as useful guides for new
Boost users evaluating how to best implement static caching on their site.


  Stand Against Poverty <http://www.standagainstpoverty.org>

    United Nations campaign website used to organize events and report event
    attendance for events at which nearly 117 million people worldwide
    participated. The events seek to raise awareness about poverty and
    highlight effort around the United Nations Millennium Development Goals
    that seek toward reducing global poverty. The website runs on a cluster
    of 4 load-balanced Apache web servers and a single database server.
    Boost is used to reduce the overall resource usage consumed by anonymous
    visitors on the site in order to devote more infrastructure resources
    toward event organizers who sign in as authenticated users to create
    events and report event attendance tallies. The Stand Against Poverty
    site is is 4 languages, and uses the i18n module. Boost was used with
    this patch http://drupal.org/node/174380#comment-663794 to allow for the
    use of Boost on i18n sites. While there is still a substantial amount of
    traffic on the website during the 3 day campaign, the impact of
    anonymous traffic (which includes all traffic, until users sign in) is
    greatly reduced.

  Environmental Working Group <http://www.ewg.org/>

    The Environmental Working Group (EWG) uses the power of public
    information to protect public health and the environment. Boost is used
    to cache all public-facing pages on the site (13,000+ and counting) and
    has been critical in sustaining EWG's large amounts of traffic since the
    site relaunched using Drupal in early 2007. EWG frequently receives
    traffic from multiple press outlets on a given day and Boost allows EWG
    to manage its infrastructure in-house and at a fraction of the price
    that would otherwise be required.


  Arto Bendiken <http://bendiken.net/>

    Personal website of the author. Boost is used to cache virtually every
    page on the site, quite significantly improving response times despite
    the sometimes sluggish shared hosting the site runs on. An additional
    benefit provided by Boost is that when the backend MySQL database server
    goes down, as happens now and then, the site still keeps on trucking
    instead of just showing the Drupal database error page (dynamic features
    such as posting comments obviously don't work until MySQL access is
    restored, however).
