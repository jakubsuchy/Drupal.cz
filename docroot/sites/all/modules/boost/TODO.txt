This is a listing of known bugs, features that mostly work but are still
somewhat in progress, features that are being considered or planned for
implementation, and just miscellaneous far-out ideas that could, in
principle, be implemented if one had the time and inclination to do so.

(NOTE: there is no guarantee any of these items will, in fact, be
implemented, nor should any possible scheduling indications be construed as
promises under any circumstances. TANSTAAFL. If you absolutely need
something implemented right now, please contact the developers to see if
they're available for contract work, or if perhaps a modest donation could
speed things along.)

TODO: FUTURE IDEAS
------------------
* An administrative interface for pre-generating static files for all pages
  on the Drupal site in one go using the Batch API.
* Add a cache current page button to block.
* Other web servers than Apache are not supported at the moment. This is due
  to the way the cache dispatch is implemented using Apache mod_rewrite
  directives in the .htaccess file. Lighttpd support would be desirable but
  is not a high priority for the developer at present.
