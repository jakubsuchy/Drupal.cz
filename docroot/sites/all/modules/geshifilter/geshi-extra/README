README file for geshi-extra directory
-------------------------------------

This directory is meant to store custom GeSHi language definition files that
are not part of the default GeSHi library. Separating custom files from a
pristine GeSHi library eases upgrading and maintenance of the GeSHi library.

If you add/remove language definition files, you need to flush the cache
of available languages before the GeSHi filter module will pick these up.
You'll find a link for this on the "Languages" tab of the GeSHi filter
module settings.
