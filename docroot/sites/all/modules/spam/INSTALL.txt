Requirements:
-------------
 - Drupal 6.x


----------
Upgrading:
----------
If upgrading from the 5.x-1.x or 5.x-2.x versions of the spam module, you MUST
FIRST upgrade to 5.x-3.0-beta1 BEFORE upgrading to the 6.x-1.x version of the
spam module.  If you neglect this step, the spam module will not work correctly
and the only solution will be to completely uninstall it and reinstall it.
After uninstalling the spam module, but before reinstalling it, you should verify
that there are no tables starting with the name 'spam'.  If any still exist,
you should manually drop them.

After upgrading from one version of the 6.x-1.x spam module to another, be sure
to always visit update.php to perform any necessary schema updates.

Installation:
-------------
1) Extract the spam tarball.  Move the resulting 'spam/' subdirectory within the
   appropriate 'sites/*/modules' directory.  Be sure the web server has read
   permissions to this directory and the files within it.

2) Log into your website and enable the spam module.

   Visit "Administer >> Site building >> Modules" and scroll down to the spam
   section.  Put a check mark next to "Spam API" and any spam filters you'd
   like to enable.  For now, we'll assume you are enabling all spam filter
   modules.  Click 'Save configuration' to enable the modules.

3) Finish enabling and configuring your spam filters.

   Visit "Administer >> Site configuration >> Spam" and put a checkbox next to
   all content types you'd like to filter.  By default the spam module will
   only scan comments.  Skip the "Actions" and "Advanced configuration" sections
   for now and click "Save configuration" if you have made any changes.

   Next, you must also click the "Filters" tab on this page to finish enabling
   your spam filters.  (Until http://drupal.org/node/541876 is fixed, you
   must visit the page any time you enable a new spam filter module.)

4) Optionally disable spam scanning for certain roles.

   Visit "Administer >> User management >> Permissions" and enable "bypass
   filters" permissions for any roles that you trust to never post spam.


The spam module is now enabled and scanning new content as it is posted on your
website.  Continue on to README.txt to learn more about configuring and using
the spam module.
