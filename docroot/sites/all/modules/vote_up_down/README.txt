Overview:
--------
This project is an attempt to build a digg.com/reddit.com clone.
There are voting widgets that mimic both, i.e. +1/-1 and +1 voting.
It builds upon a number of other module, se below.

AJAX functionality is used for voting if the browser supports it
(using drupal.js included in Druapl 4.7). Bookmarklets are supported
for quickly submitting new story links. A number of RSS feeds are
available.

This is not a point and click solution. This project provide the missing
pieces but you need to put them all together. Please try it out and
report back with bugs you find and suggestions you have.

Installation and configuration:
------------------------------
See INSTALL.txt contributed by Ron Williams.


Theme story links:
-----------------
If you use a PHPTemplate theme you can theme story links nodes with a
"node-storylink.tpl.php" file.

An example "node-storylink.tpl.php" and "template.php" is included.
Place them in the folder of your theme. The examples are styled with the
css file "vote_up_down.css" in the vote_up_down module folder.

In "alternative" there are a "node-storylink.tpl.php" for use with the 
"Alternative +1 vote style" (digg style) voting widget.

The example include these functions:
* Make the title an external link to the submitted story.
* Inserts the voting widget directly for greater control.
* Inserts the domain of the submitted story url like "(via example.com)".
* Displays a small user picture above the voting widget.

OBS! When using "node-storylink.tpl.php" you must turn off
"Vote widget display..." in "admin/settings/vote_up_down" to avoid
getting double voting widgets.


Bookmarklet to submit story links:
---------------------------------
javascript:location.href='http://www.example.com/node/add/storylink?edit[url]='+encodeURIComponent(location.href)+'&edit[title]='+encodeURIComponent(document.title)

Replace "www.example.com" with your domain.

  This has cut down on the support requst considerbly and
  has made the package much more accessible for users.

* jQuery verision of ajax_vote_up_down.js by Nedjo Rogers.
  The Drupal 5 version whould have taken a *lot* longer
  if I have had to do this myself.
