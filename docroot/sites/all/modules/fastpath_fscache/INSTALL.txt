Name: fastpath_fscache.module

Description: File-based page caching mechanism for Drupal rather than
             storing cached pages in the database.

Maintainers:  Jeremy Andrews <jeremy AT kerneltrap DOT org> and
              Matt Westgate <drupal AT asitis DOT org> and
           
Dependancies:
  This module works with Drupal HEAD only


INSTALLATION:
********************************************************************

1. Place the entire fastpath_fscache directory into your Drupal 
   modules/ folder.
   
NOTE: It is not enough to just enable this module. Please follow all these 
      steps. 
   
2. Enable this module by navigating to:

     administer » modules
     
   The module will attempt to create a folder named 'cache' within your Drupal 
   'files' folder.

3. At the bottom of your settings.php file, add the following PHP code:

    $conf = array(
      'page_cache_fastpath' => 1,
      'cache_inc' => './modules/custom/fastpath_fscache/cache.fs.inc',
      'file_cache' => './files/cache'
    );
    
  This enables file-based caching at the Drupal level, and also sets up 
  the paths to your cache.fs.inc file and cache directory:
  
4. Enable page caching by navigating to:

     administer » page caching

5. CRON must configured properly on your site. Take a look at Drupal's 
   INSTALL.txt file for setup instructions. This module relies on cron to 
   remove stale files, so you'll want cron to run often, say every 5-15 
   minutes. In the future we hope to give admins more control over the 
   expiration time.
