Installation
-----------------------------
1) Extract the 'texy/' directory from inside the module package to the
   'sites/all/modules/' directory of your Drupal installation. This package
   includes also the needed Texy! library, and auto-detects the correct
   version, so no additional downloads needed. But however, you might want
   to check the official website http://texy.info/en/download for possible
   updates (replace files inside the 'sites/all/modules/texy/texy'
   subdirectory).

2) Enable the module at admin/build/modules.

3) Create a new data format at admin/settings/filters/add and assign the Texy!
   filter to it. Give your users permission to use the new format.

You're done!
