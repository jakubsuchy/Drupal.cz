INSTALLATION
------------

Decompress the print-n.x-n.n.tar.gz file into your Drupal modules
directory (usually sites/all/modules, see http://drupal.org/node/176044 for
more information).

Enable the print module: Administer > Site building > Modules
  (admin/build/modules)

PDF TOOL
--------

The print_pdf module requires the use of an external PDF generation tool.
The currently supported tools are dompdf and TCPDF. Please note that any
errors/bugs in those tools need to be reported and fixed by their
maintainers. DO NOT report bugs in those tools in the print module's issue
queue at Drupal.org.

dompdf support:
  The dompdf tool produces results that are more faithful to the HTML
  printer-friendly page. Unicode is not supported (only ISO-8859-1).
  This tool is not supported and there are several known bugs that result
  from its incomplete implementation.

  1. Download dompdf from http://sourceforge.net/projects/dompdf/
  2. Extract the contents of the downloaded package into the print module
  directory (usually sites/all/modules/print)
  3. Check if dompdf_config.inc.php fits your installation. In 99% of cases,
  no changes are necessary, so just try to use it and only edit anything if
  the PDF generation fails.
  4. Grant write access to the lib/fonts directory to your webserver user.
  5. If you're using dompdf-0.5.1, delete the dompdf.php file as it contains
  a security vulnerability
  6. Check http://www.digitaljunkies.ca/dompdf/ for further information.

TCPDF support:
  TCPDF seems to be more actively developed than dompdf, but it's support
  for CSS is considerably worse. Unicode is supported (use of Unicode fonts
  result in HUGE files). Page header and footer are supported. This module
  requires TCPDF >= 4.0.000.

  1. Download TCPDF from http://sourceforge.net/projects/tcpdf/
  2. Extract the contents of the downloaded package into the print module
  directory (usually sites/all/modules/print). There is no need to modify
  the config/tcpdf_config.php file, as the module self-configures TCPDF.
  3. Check http://tcpdf.sourceforge.net/ for further information.

UPDATE
------

When updating from a previous version, just remove the print directory and
follow the instructions above. Make sure that you backup any costumization
to the print.tpl.php and print.css files.

ROBOTS
------

Even though it is possible to set per-page robots settings, the following
can be placed in your robots.txt file after the User-agent line to prevent
search engines from even asking for the page:

Disallow: /print/

Also, for updates from older versions (<=4.7.x-1.0 and <=5.x-1.2) which used
node/nnn/print instead of print/nnn, the following lines can prevent
requests from Google for the obsolete print URLs:

Disallow: /*/print$

Note that pattern matching in robots.txt is a Google extension (see
http://www.google.com/support/webmasters/bin/answer.py?answer=40367 for more
information).
