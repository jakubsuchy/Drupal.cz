---------------------------
6.x-1.0-alpha2 (2009-09-23)
---------------------------
This release requires Signup version 6.x-1.0-rc6 or later.  However,
sites should install signup_status 6.x-1.0-alpha2 and visit update.php
first, then install signup 6.x-1.0-rc6 and visit update.php again.

The primary change in this release is the re-introduction of
per-status limits by means of a new "Signup status limit" sub-module.
There are also changes to both Signup and Signup status that make the
"Modifies signup count" checkbox when configuring signup status
options actually work.

The basic status functionality is working better, but this is still
not an "official" release meant for production sites.  New features
will be added, APIs will probably change, and the database schema
might change before the official 6.x-1.0 release.  Please do not
install this and then come complaining that parts of it aren't working
yet. ;)  We know.  Please check the issue queue on drupal.org
(http://drupal.org/project/issues/signup_status) before reporting any
problems or "missing" functionality.

Bugs fixed since version 6.x-1.0-alpha1:
= #581826 by dww: Fixed the "Modify signup count" checkbox when
  configuring status codes to actually do something by means of
  #581734 and #581652.
= #581826 by dww: Fixed the status settings UI so that if an admin
  changes the "Modify signup count" for any status values, or if the
  status they reassign signups to when deleting a status has a
  different value, we now use Batch API to update all the signups,
  recompute the effective totals and check the signup limits on all
  affected nodes.
= #582250 by dww: Fixed bug where signups were left with bogus data
  after deleting a signup status. If you delete a status that has some
  signups using that status, the confirm form now asks you what status
  you'd like to reassign the signups to, and there's a batching
  function to update all the signups and invoke the signup status
  change hooks.
= #583010 by dww: Fixed bug where users that could not edit their own
  signup could still toggle their signup status.
= #581768 by dww: Added missing hook_schema_alter() implementation to
  warn the world that we've modified the {signup_log} schema.

New features since version 6.x-1.0-alpha1:
= #581846 by dww: Cleaned up the admin settings UI and added status
  weights, which allow an admin to reorder the status options visible
  on the signup form.
= #359412 by dww: Added the "Signup status limit" sub-module to
  properly implement per-status limits. Includes major improvements to
  the UI for configuring per-status limits (see #241869), and it
  actually integrates properly with the limits enforced by the
  Signup module.
= #583154 by dww: Altered the node/N/signups/admin signup summary
  fieldset (see #578592) to include per-status limit data.

Other changes since version 6.x-1.0-alpha1:
= #578344 by dww: Added a "Signup" group on the module administration
  page (admin/build/modules) for all the signup-related modules.
= #581734 by dww: Take advantage of the new Signup API to simplify the
  code for writing the signup status value to the {signup_log} table.


---------------------------
6.x-1.0-alpha1 (2009-08-23)
---------------------------

Initial release compatible with Drupal 6 core. This release requires
Signup 6.x-1.0-rc5 or later. Installing Views and Views Bulk
Operations (VBO) is highly recommended, but not required.

The basic status functionality is working fine, but this is not an
"official" release meant for production sites. New features will be
added, APIs will almost certainly change, and the database schema
might change before the official 6.x-1.0 release. Please do not
install this and then come complaining that parts of it aren't working
yet. ;) We know. Please check the issue queue before reporting any
problems or "missing" functionality.

Some of the functionality in the D5 version has been removed. Some of
it, in particular per-status limits will be restored in the future,
and better integrated with the Signup module's own concept of signup
limits. Other features have been moved into sub-modules.

There are a handful of brand new sub-modules such as Signup Status
Notifications (which automatically subscribes users to node
notifications depending on their signup status) and Signup Status
Invite (which lets users send invitations to other users and they are
automatically signed up with a certain status -- intended for sites
that use a signup status such as "Invited").

The Signup Status Mailer module has been completely re-written to
provide per-status and per-node email templates along with site-wide
per-status defaults. Installing the Token module is highly recommended
for sites that wish to use Signup Status Mailer.
