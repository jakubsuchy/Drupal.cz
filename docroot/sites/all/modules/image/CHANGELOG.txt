[Gerhard Killesreiter]

_image_check_configuration: Add test for slashes at the end of dirs.
                            Changed some echos to prints

2 October 2002
----------------
[Moshe Weitzman]

added a fast directory upload option. this enables an admin to load
a bunch of images into drupal in a single pass. the same taxonomy terms
are applied to all, thus creating a gallery. if IPTC info is present, it
is used to populate the title, body, and teaser fields. IPTC tagging is
a great way to prep your images while offline See Help for more info on IPTC tools.

If IPTC info is present during standard image node compose, it
is proposed as the node title, body and teaser

imagemagick created thumbnails use 'scale' instead of 'resize'.
this is more compatible with prior versions of imagemagick,
and ISPs don't update this library often.

added some Help, particularly for IPTC and directory upload functions. much more is needed.

1 October 2002
------------------
[Gerhard Killesreiter]
- All configurable directories now need slashes at the end.
  You will need to add a slash to the temp directory in
