READ THIS FILE if you are updating from previous versions of image.module. If you are
installing image.module for the first time, you may ignore this file.

image.module has an automated update system similar to Drupal core. This updater will help
you upgrade from the version 4.4.0 version of image.module to newer versions. To use it,
follow these steps:


(1) Move update-image.php to the root directory of your site (next to update.php or index.php).
(2) Open this script at "http://my.site.com/update-image.php".
(3) For security, remove the update-image.php script.
