msgid "<p>The Login Toboggan module improves the Drupal login system by offering the following features:\n      <ol>\n      <li>Allow users to login using either their username OR their e-mail address.</li>\n      <li>Allow users to define their own password during registration.</li>\n      <li>Allow users to login immediately.</li>\n      <li>Provide a login form on Access Denied pages for non-logged-in (anonymous) users.</li>\n      <li>The module provides two login block options: One uses JavaScript to display the form within the block immediately upon clicking 'log in'. The other brings the user to a separate page, but returns the user to their original page upon login.</li>\n      <li>Customize the registration form with two e-mail fields to ensure accuracy.</li>\n      <li>Optionally redirect the user to a specific page when using the 'Immediate login' feature.</li>\n      <li>Optionally redirect the user to a specific page upon validation of their e-mail address.</li>\n      <li>Optionally display a user message indicating a successful login.</li>\n      </ol>\n      These features may be turned on or off in the Login Toboggan <a href=\"!url\">settings</a>.</p>\n      <p>Because this module completely reorients the Drupal login process you will probably want to edit the welcome e-mail on the user settings page. For instance if you have enabled the 'Set password & Immediate Login' option, you probably should not send the user's password out in the welcome e-mail (also note when the 'Set password & Immediate Login' option is enabled, the !login_url becomes a verification url that the user MUST visit in order to enable authenticated status). The following is an example welcome e-mail:</p>\n      "

msgid "<p>Note that if you have set the 'Visitors can create accounts but administrator approval is required' option for account approval, and are also using the 'Set password & Immediate Login' feature of LoginToboggan, the user will immediately receive the permissions of the pre-authorized user role -- you may wish to create a pre-authorized role with the exact same permissions as the anonymous user if you wish the newly created user to only have anonymous permissions.</p><p>In order for a site administrator to unblock a user who is awaiting administrator approval, they must either click on the validation link they receive in their notification e-mail, or manually remove the user from the site's pre-authorized role -- afterwards the user will then receive 'authenticated user' permissions. In either case, the user will receive an account activated e-mail if it's enabled on the user settings page -- it's recommended that you edit the default text of the activation e-mail to match LoginToboggan's workflow as described. </p><p>If you are using the 'Visitors can create accounts and no administrator approval is required' option, removal of the pre-authorized role will happen automatically when the user validates their account via e-mail.</p><p>Also be aware that LoginToboggan only affects registrations initiated by users--any user account created by an administrator will not use any LoginToboggan functionality."
